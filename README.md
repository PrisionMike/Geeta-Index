## Notes from Geeta

This is a non-clustered index for referencing terms stated in BhagwadGeeta - with commentary by Swami Ramsukh Das.

Starting with Chapter 8: verse 4. Ideally it would be all in Hindi but I am bad at typing it :/. The digital version of the book also doesn't seem to be available in a format where I can copy and paste the text. Would be very happy if someone could raise an Issue with a link to such a book. Thanks. :)
